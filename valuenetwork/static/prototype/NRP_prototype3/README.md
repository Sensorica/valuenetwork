# NRP Prototype 3

1/26/16 Chris Troutner:
This third prototype was born from Prototype 2, which was born from [this project](https://github.com/requirejs/example-multipage-shim).

My goals for this iteration is to write a very simple API interface that does the following:

* Open the people.html page.
* Retrieve a list of People from the NRP API.
* Display the list of People in a list on the People. When a person is clicked in the list, display their info in a 'card'. This will also list out all projects this person is associated with.
* When a project is clicked, it will navigate to the project.html page and open a similar card displaying info on the project.
