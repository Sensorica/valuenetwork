# NRP UI Prototype
This is a Backbone.js and Require.js project.

* Require.js allows for modular programming of JavaScript programs. Backbone Models, Views, and Templates can all live in their own file/directory structure and be compiled at run time rather than stuffing everything into one giant file (traditional development).
