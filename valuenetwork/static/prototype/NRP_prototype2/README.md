This represent my first successful attempt to get Backbone.js, Require.js, and the AdminLTE template to run and play nice together. After I got it running, I created Prototype 3 so that I could use this project as a blank canvas.

Require.js is an asyncronous javascript library loader. It also allows the use of modulare code - putting views, models, templets, etc code in their own files and compiling at run time. It also allows the explicit declaration of dependencies so that you can ensure some libraries are loaded *after* or *before* others.
Backbone.js is a JavaScript framework much like Angular.js or Ember.js. Backbone is light and unopinionated. It has a lot of built in functions to keep data syncronized with the server.
AdminLTE is an awesome open source Bootstrap template.
